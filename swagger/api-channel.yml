    Allow property manager websites and management tools to

  Channel:
    type: apiKey
    in: query
    name: channel
    description: |
      If you are implementing a system which manages data for multiple
      property managers you will have been given a "Channel ID" to use
      when sending requests. This channel identifies your system, and
      it will then be checked that your channel on the website has been
      granted access to the property manager ID you provide in each
      request
  PropertyManager:
    type: apiKey
    in: query
    name: landlord
    description: |
      The ID of the property manager whose data you wish to fetch (as provided by a call to GET /summary)
  Timestamp:
    type: apiKey
    in: query
    name: timestamp
    description: Unix epoch timestamp in seconds, used to prevent API replay. The timestamp can be a maximum of one hour in the past, and may not be in the future
  Auth:
    type: apiKey
    in: query
    name: auth
    description: |
      Find your "channel" key at sturents.com/software/developer when signed in as a user with access to your channel.

      The "auth" query parameter will be an HMAC SHA256 of the timestamp,
      signed with your "channel" API key.

      e.g. in PHP,

      $auth = hash_hmac('sha256', $timestamp, $channel_key)

  /summary:
    get:
      summary: 1. Fetch property managers
      description: |
        Returns all property managers that your channel has been provided with access to. You will need the "landlord" ID for each property manager to send /properties requests and fetch their properties.
        
        Each record also has a property manager and organisation title that you can use within your platform to tag and manage different property managers.
        
        Property manager IDs should not change but you should still periodically request this endpoint to ensure you are only accessing property managers for whom your channel has access - records may be added or removed at any time based on property manager or admin actions in the StuRents platform.

        Using a "landlord" value from the /summary endpoint you can request all properties (paginated) for that property manager.
        
        This endpoint is rate limited and you may only request properties for a given property manager once in 15 minute period. We generally recommend a refresh schedule of 1 hour is reasonable for up to date data - most property managers do not change the same data multiple times within an hour.

        Provides the booking status and basic contract information for a hosted booking.
        
        You must be set up by our commercial team to access booking journeys. This requires you to submit extra data when redirecting tenants to our "book now" URLs that allow you to retrieve their booking status later. Talk to our commercial team to learn more.
        
        Once set up, you should retrive the book_now_url fields from property contract objects, and append your own query string parameters. These must include "booking_id" as a custom unique ID from your platform, and "email" as the tenant's email address, which will be pre-filled in the booking form.
        
        You may optionally send "first_name" and "phone" fields to pre-populate these to help the tenant's journey and increase conversion rates.
